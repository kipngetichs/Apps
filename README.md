# Task
My task was to analyze the Google Play Store dataset, focusing on both free and paid apps, to extract meaningful insights for developers and stakeholders. This involved cleaning and preparing the data, performing exploratory analysis to uncover trends in reviews, installs, content ratings, and genres, and identifying challenges in app engagement. I developed actionable recommendations to optimize app visibility, improve user satisfaction, and enhance market competitiveness. Additionally, I created visualizations and a detailed report to present these findings effectively.
# Action
Using Power BI and SQL, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Google Play Store dataset to derive actionable insights for free and paid apps. I began by cleaning the data in SQL, which included removing duplicates, handling null values where necessary, and identifying and eliminating outliers using Z-scores. Ensuring accurate data types, I then imported the refined dataset into Power BI to create interactive dashboards. These visualizations revealed trends in reviews, installs, content ratings, and genres, enabling detailed segmentation analysis. Finally, I compiled a comprehensive report and dashboards to present these findings, providing developers and stakeholders with strategies to enhance app performance and market impact.The preview of Dashboard is available below.
